NALIR py
--------

This project is a **NALIR** (Natural Language Interface for Database Systems) implementation in python. 
The orginal source code was written in java. In order to get more knowledge of how NALIR works (its components and how they work together), we've decide to develop our own implementation in python code, a more modern language then JAVA. Python has more modern NLP libraries and it can help us in order to improve the NALIR algortithms. The idea for doing this commings out from Altigran supervising Brandell Cássio (graduate student) and Rafael(undergraduate Student) in their research themes.  

This project follows the [Google Python Code Style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)
